# Bazel

Following tutorial from https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/tutorial/cpp.html


## Starlark Language
The language used in Bazel (BUILD and .bzl files), syntactically a subset of Python 3.
Some small differences with Python include:
  - global variables $\iff$ `const`
  - `for` and `if` have to be inside of a function
  - no recursion, while, yield
  - class $\rightarrow$ struct, import $\rightarrow$ load
  - string concatenation, lambda, chained comparisons, float and set are not supported


#### Some Useful Commands

###### To build a project
Go to the directory with **WORKSPACE** file (identifies this directory as the root of the project's directory structure)

`bazel build //main:hello-world`
              $\qquad \qquad \qquad\qquad\uparrow$
          $\qquad \qquad$ relative path from root

###### BUILD file
```
cc_library(
    name = "hello-greet",
    srcs = ["hello-greet.cc"],
    hdrs = ["hello-greet.h"],
)

cc_binary(
@recommended -world",
@recommended o-world.cc"],
@recommended
@recommended reet",
@recommended
@recommended
)
```
- If there are $x$ packages in the project, would have $x$ subdirectories each containing a BUILD file.

- The default target are only visible to other targets in the same BUILD file so may need to explicitly set ***visibility***
    ```
    cc_library(
        name = "hello-time",
        srcs = ["hello-time.cc"],
        hdrs = ["hello-time.h"],
        visibility = ["//main:__pkg__"],
    )
    ```

###### Testing
To test the built project, run `bazel-bin/main/hello-world` from root directory

###### Labels
Syntax for *labels*: `//path/to/package:target-name`

- If referencing targets within the same package, can skip the package path
  - Same BUILD file - `:target-name`
  - same path - `//:target-name`
- If the target is a rule target, `path/to/package` is the path to the directory containing the BUILD file
- If the target is a file target then `path/to/package` is the path to the root of the file

## Rules
A rule defines the set of actions that Bazel should perform to get the outputs.

A new rule : `
my_rule = rule(...)
`
Load the rule in BUILD files: `load('//some/pkg:whatever.bzl', 'my_rule')`

#### Attributes
Attributes are rule argument such as `srcs` and `deps`

An example from *cpp-tutorial/stage3/main*
```
my_rule = rule(
  implementation = _my_impl,
  attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(
            allow_files = True,
        )
    },
)
```
In this example, `srcs` is defined to be an attribute of my_rule. The type of `srcs` is `label_list`, defined in *attr* module.

To use this rule, load and call the rule in the BUILD file
```
load("//main:my_rule.bzl", "my_rule")

my_rule(
  name = "hello-greet",
  srcs = ["hello-greet.cc"],
)
```
To add an private attribute, add an underscore before just as in python.
  - e.g., *"_compiler": ...*


#### Implementation function
This is required for every rule.
This function is executed strictly in the analysis phase and performs series of actions that should be achieved with this rule.
  - It only takes in parameter *rule context* or *ctx*
    - *ctx* can be used to access attribute values, obtain input and output files, create actions and pass information to other target dependencies
    - e.g., `ctx.attr.<attribute_name>` `ctx.file` `ctx.label.name`
  - Convention: private, usually named `_impl`


#### Files
Use `ctx.files` to access input files of a target (`ctx.attr` works too).
Use `ctx.outputs` to access output attributes (can't use `ctx.attr` since it only returns the label).

#### Actions
Execute actions to generate a set of outputs from a set of inputs.
  - `ctx.actions.run`  $\rightarrow$ run an executable
  - `ctx.actions.run_shell`  $\rightarrow$ run a shell command
  - `ctx.actions.write`  $\rightarrow$ write a string to a file
  - `ctx.actions.expand_template`  $\rightarrow$ to generate a file from a template

In addition, there are various situations that should be noted
- **If an action generates a file that is not listed in its outputs**: This is fine, but the file will be ignored and cannot be used by other rules.

- **If an action does not generate a file that is listed in its outputs**: This is an execution error and the build will fail. This happens for instance when a compilation fails.

- **If an action generates an unknown number of outputs and you want to keep them all**, you must group them in a single file (e.g., a zip, tar, or other archive format). This way, you will be able to deterministically declare your outputs.

- **If an action does not list a file it uses as an input**, the action execution will most likely result in an error. The file is not guaranteed to be available to the action, so if it is there, itâ€™s due to coincidence or error.

- **If an action lists a file as an input, but does not use it**: This is fine. However, it can affect action execution order, resulting in sub-optimal performance.

#### Providers
Only way rules exchange data with each other
Communicate using the `provider` function:
`Info = provider(fields=["value"])`

Then define a implementation function and return the provider instances
```
def rule_implementation(ctx):
  ...
  return [Info(value=5)]
```

`Info` is both a provider constructor and a key to access them. A rule can access the providers of its dependencies as accessing key `Info` in a hashmap. The target maps from each provider the target supports to the target's corresponding instance of that provider.

```
def dependent_rule_implementation(ctx):
  ...
  n = 0
  for dep_target in ctx.attr.deps:
    n += dep_target[Info].value
  ...
```
Note how `dep_target[Info]` yields the instance of that provider and we can access its value.

#### Executables rules
Executables rules define targets that can be invoked by a `bazel run` command.

An example from https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/blob/master/rules/executable/fortune.bzl
```
def _haiku_fortune_impl(ctx):
    ...

    # Emit the executable shell script.
    script = ctx.actions.declare_file("%s-fortune" % ctx.label.name)
    script_content = script_template.format(
        fortunes_file = datafile.short_path,
        num_fortunes = len(ctx.attr.srcs),
    )
    ctx.actions.write(script, script_content, is_executable = True)

    # The datafile must be in the runfiles for the executable to see it.
    runfiles = ctx.runfiles(files = [datafile])
    return [DefaultInfo(executable = script, runfiles = runfiles)]

haiku_fortune = rule(
    implementation = _haiku_fortune_impl,
    attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(
            allow_files = True,
            doc = "Input haiku files. Each file must have exactly three lines. " +
                  "The last line must be terminated by a newline character.",
        ),
    },
    executable = True,
```

This example demonstrates how an executable is generated. For a `ctx.actions.run()` or `ctx.actions.run_shell()` action this should be done by the underlying tool that is invoked by the action. For a `ctx.actions.write()` action it is done by passing the argument `is_executable=True`.
